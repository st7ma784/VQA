"73",3,"Picnic.1","right well I can currently see a picture here and erm um and I'm guessing its currently spring time looking by the color of the trees there are 3 people one of them is wearing a blue jumper they are all standing and none of them look very happy and um there are some (indistinguishable) in the background and all of them are male"
"74",3,"Coffee.1","Here I can see a cup of coffee its got a sort of frothy top bit with a heart shape on the top and there are some sprinkles of black which I I assume might be chocolate might be coffee on the top, there's a spoon its in a white sort of mug thing on a squarish saucer with rounded edges and there is a sachet of probable sugar but I've never seen a type of sugar that's that width before urm so might be sweetener erm and its got 1 of those handles that's slightly triangle"
"75",3,"Graveyard.2","Here I am looking at erm what looks like an empty field in the background there's a hedge there's is no stone work visible so I'm guessing its in the country side somewhere in the distance I can see a small building I'm guessing a farm house and it looks like  its probably going the crop is probably going to grow quite soon but it's a field its kind of bear"
"76",3,"Gun.7","Here I am looking at a machine gun I think it might be a browning or though that does look like quite a hefty barrel so it might be more tank mounted and slightly larger than that er erm its black or dark metal grey erm there are 2 things that look like stabilizers arching over the top of it and its got a handle that looks like its partially wooden on the side that would be for cocking the weapon ready to fire and some handles at the back and I imagine it makes a really loud noise when it fires er the background is quite bleary but its mostly sky or a very large sheet of something that's blue with a sort of triangle very probably trees down in the bottom right hand corner"
"77",3,"Sunset.4","Er here I can see a really lovely image erm its either sunset or sunrise over a lake probably the lake district I vaguely recognize it erm to the left hand side of the picture you've got the slight- curving slope of a nice mountain or hill reflected in the water which is slightly ripely no it's a slight mark on the screen I thought I could see some reedy bits in the foreground but no that's not real er though it looks like there might be a bit of algae in the water but er algae not withstanding it is indeed a lovely view and yes I'd quite like to go there actually"
"78",3,"Rock.climbing.2","Erm here I can see a picture that looks like a er some form of climber he's side ways and appears to be attached to the rock using some form of chain he's sort of climbing up and undercut of what looks to be some type of chalky cliff by the white colour or though down by the bottom of the picture its starts to go a little bit grey some plants erm, while he is attached by a chain he doesn't appear to be hanging off the chain he appears to be hanging off by hand and foot which is quite of impressive really he's got greenish safety harness and some red rope"
"79",3,"Fire.3","Here we can see some bank clerks going about their usual businesses there is 1 customer waiting in the queue I'm not what type or which bank it is but judging by the colour it might be Santander as there are some red highlights, there are 2 clerks 1 of which is on the phone the other seems to be looking up beckoning a customer forwards erm the 1 on the telephone she's also looking at her computer screen the other clerk is male"
"80",3,"Galaxy.5","Here we can see what looks to be almost a  painting but it might be a filter if astronauts  have filters of the earth and some sort of patterns of what looks vaguely like the aurora but you can see the entire earth so must be a long way away so this might be an artists rendering of some type of solar flare erm and the stars look like they've been taken out of some type of nativity scene they're little circles with plus signs superimposed on them but plus signs are more pointy the that not really show how to describe those you can see that I've the earth is kinda cloudy or you can see the bit that's got the ice  sheet on It on top well top left of the earth the earth is slightly off centre in the image slightly to the right but its basically on the centre line erm yeah at a guess its day tie on the left hand side of the earth because its brighter than the rest of it that's dark"
"81",3,"Hangover.1","Erm here we see a man exhausted by work you can see that he's actually collapsed over his desk and next to him there's some sort of office phone or tablet erm and I'm guessing he been in or just come out of some office meeting  that has lasted for forever and he is nackered what he could really do with is s cup of coffee by the looks of it or waking up either his glasses are out of shot or he doesn't ware glasses and by the looks of it he's quite low level as his desk seems to be made out of some cheap plasticky stuff"
"82",3,"Snake.5","Erm we can see  a snake its got a lovely pattern in red and gold with sort of little white bits background is grass its got stripes as you go down to the end of the tail and its twisted it self into a shape very vaguely reminiscent of a badly made pretzel erm look its little tongues out and it looks vaguely like its going to strike some form of mouse though I'm not a snake expert so but it looks kinda like its posed but low posed its not rearing up like a cobra"
"83",3,"Cat.5","And here we can see 2 really really sweet adorable kittens erm which are lovely erm one of them erm the 1 on the left has its eyes one the 1 on the right has its eyes shut they appear to be either just waking up from or just about to have a nap in a lovely purple towel they look very sweet if I wasn't allergic to cats I'd like one of them or possibly both they've got very pink noses and going out from that they've got white and they've got reddish bits towards the eyes and on top they've got black hair they look vaguely like they could be twins"
"84",3,"Bear.2","Here we can see a walrus it got sort of greyish skin and where walruses go not shaggy but a bit of folded skin erm you can see that its missing 1 of its tusk looks a bit scarred as well I'm guessing its an old walrus there kind of a slightly sad look in its eyes and it does kind of look like its in its own you can see the sea in the background not a particularly nice looking day and yeah it erm its on a rock with the sea in the background and the sea also in the foreground  but then the rock takes up most of the middle bit erm you've got the sea down towards the right bottom hand side erm in the foreground just gently lapping where the waves get a little more fearsome in the top left and you can also see a fishing trawler in the background which might account for the sad look in the walruses eyes"
"85",3,"Police.2","Here you can see a squad of special forces erm they are erm I'm guessing American by the size and type of vehicles in the background erm by the vehicle on the right which is mostly obscured by the huddle of 3 men in green helmets with cameo trousers they might be a swat team with a variety of weapons all in black and they're all uniformed in the background there's a person stood with what looks to be a dark thunderbird uniform which is interesting and he's just sort of stood their hand behind his back looking at them erm which as they've got guns out I'd have possibly have hidden but that's him, the ground is red sand and there's appears to be a goal post in the background"
"86",3,"Bird.3","Here we've got some water fowl I can never remember the name for this type of bird its water hen or the ones which are black with a sort of red frill and they've got white around there eyes erm and its paddling away looks like its also got a chic which is interesting as I've never seen the its not a water chicken that particular type of birds chic before he's only got 1 there it sort of small brown they appear to be paddling toward the reed which are other towards the left of the photo to the right of the photo it extends to a river there's algae the waters fairly smooth so might not be a river might be some form of lake, and just above just next to the reeds you can see something that might be the bark of a tree so they might be going off to they're nest under the river bank some where its actually kinda nice that 1 I've learnt a bit"
"87",3,"Lightning.3","Here we can see a wonderful bolt of lightning with more forks than I can easily count which is good only 1 of them is actually touching the ground the others sort of snake off and I've fade into the background or go off the side of the screen and 1 of them actually goes back up off out of the top of the screen 2 of them do even, but you can see that the main white streak goes wiggles down from the top centre down to the bottom left and strikes some form of city going by the light  but its very small very in the background difficult to tell er there's an open stretch of water so perhaps its some form of port city you can see a bridge also in the background and then in the foreground you can see lights of a mariner"
"88",3,"Shark.4","Here you can see the underside of an otter and it looks like its got a chic not a chic pup small one miniature otter anyway I think there pups yeah because you get dig otters difficult to tell exactly where they are because your looking upwards  at it but you can see the clear blue sky above them twinkling through the ripples in the water so I'm guessing theatre out side which means they're probably at sea erm over towards the left there's something it looks a bit its fuzzy mostly out of shot I think it might be the underside of a hull of a boat possibly or maybe just the edge of it and there's something trailing from the right well by the direction the photo was taken this could be part of the kit of the diver and I should say  it's out of magnification which makes sense as the diver is going to have to be a little way away from the otter as they tend to be a little bit scared of people understandably the otters just swimming along and its looking over its left shoulder um at the pup which is also on its left so presumably its mummy otter checking that its pup is learning how to swim but is also trying to lead her baby somewhere so perhaps it is a boat and mummy otter is trying to get them round the boat theirs a couple of fuzzy blobs in the sky but they're horribly distorted by the water so sea gulls probably or clouds actually no there to small to be clouds er well go with unknown sea birds"
"89",3,"Skydiving.1","Here we can see some parachutist who haven't actually deployed there parachutes yet 3 of them have got smoke trailing from them erm there's 2 with yellow and 1 with green the 1 with green is in the middle there are several parachutes 1 2 34 5 6 7 7 parachutists blue skies and they appear to be other some sort of mountain range as its all foldy as mountain ranges from the sky tend to look um I'd would suggest that they should potentially be opening their shoots soonish as the ground doesn't look that far away thought that could be an optical illusion although that could just be an optical illusion, you can almost see a foot path though going across 1 of the mountain ridges  may have to find out where that is and go for a walk up that path if it has that so of weather the views must be astonishing you can see a very craggy bit over towards the right yeah that looks nice they're all wearing black um black kit black sort of jumpsuit things except 1 of them has got a blue parachute bag thing  and is holding hands with their instructor"
"90",3,"Mother.1","Here we can see a father holding his son up in the air the son doesn't seem to have any noticeable hair which would make sense erm because their small although judging erm 1 doesn't want to look to closely but judging by the waist area they seem to be wearing a nappy the hand that is extended because this is a silhouette is bare as our both feet it looks to be a md day scene the sky is nice and blue over towards the back right hand photo there is a blob that looks like it could be some form of ship, there appears to be steam trailing from part of it so that would make sense  and also over towards the left hand side of the picture there is a ship the sea comes to about half way up the side of the screen the sun is reflecting off the water the father is bold like his well not like his son but theirs not much hair their erm and he seems happy he's holding his son up in the air and is looking at him"
"91",3,"Car.crash.1","Here we can see that the remains of a car that has been crashed the bonnet should be covering the engine as apposed to displaced to one side the wind screen is a ruin the car is grey its on a road with a dull yellow line down the middle dashed white lines down the middle of the road the background there is green grass with some coniferous stuff behind the grass there's no one visible in the car which is good so it looks like they actually  got out   cus whatever they done to their vehicle its nasty difficult to tell what type of car it was I'm going to go for the new Volkswagen beetle type thing cus as seen 1 in that colour before but the distinguishable features are a mess"
"92",3,"Explosion.1","Here we can see iron man walking away from a massive explosion, I think this is a picture taken from the first iron man film it looks like the mk2 I think the first 1 that was actually red with the gold bits erm its walking there's sort of that pale dust erm so I think it is that scene in the afghan settlement massive pretty explosion in the background which is what you want from an iron man film and yeah you can just see folding away into his shoulder is the powering mechanism for the missile he's just used to create that rather phenomenally large explosion erm to the right hand side to the bottom of the screen a mother cradles her child yeah he's just saved them"
"93",3,"Knife.1","In this picture I can see a knife it looks like its been very badly Photoshop as all of the edges of everything are sort of crinkly although then their rather correct shadows there's a reflection in the grannie- (granite) looking surface then the shadow going in the other direction erm other than that the top is (the work- the) granite surface is completely bare it's just got some white circles in it  as granite does erm the knife looks like its some sort of folding utility knife its got some sort of folding bit sticking out of the back of the handle there are many mini circles in the handle that appear to be their for aesthetic  purposes erm and then the sufficient nuts and bolty type looking things near the blade that make it look like it probably folds the back of the blade is crinkled so it could be a meant to be a saw but it's the front the actually the cutting edge of the blade its all juddery, just badly photo shopped the blade its got what looks to be an eye etched into it and then and then some other engraving but I can't quite work out what it is because it's a bit blurry the handle has got a black section on it and then the rest of it is stainless steel probably the blade is slightly greyer."
"94",3,"Cat.1","Here we have a dog with green eyes yes but its that sort of grainy brown erm bit like mine have occasionally been described to be erm its got brown fur , I'm not knowledgeable about dogs its not a Labrador erm saint Bernard I think erm its sort of got that (it it sort of skin is) folded but then its not got particularly long fur so it doesn't look horribly shaggy erm in the background you've got a nice wooden table I'm guessing piranha pine erm and its on a very pleasant looking erm floorboarded floor but the floorboards are flat so it looks fairly new erm that's about it really erm on the table you can just see the edge- the  bottom of a red mug I'm going for by the handle the table sort of to the left hand side of the screen and the mugs so the mug is  about top  3 quarters of the way to the right hand side so 1 quarter from the left and then the dog is centre frame erm its orientated so its body is to the left hand side of the screen and its head is looking straight at you in the middle erm its expression kinda indicates it wants some sort of biscuit"
"95",3,"Car.race.2","Here we can see some cars going round a race track you've got the- they go round a corner theirs the red and white stripes going round the inside of the bend er theirs a yellow car 2 green cars 2 orange cars and a white one they've all got spoilers they look like normal production cars so its not stop car racing it's the it might be (lamones) erm one of them has rac written on it but that does not look like a (indistinguishable) Rac van erm they all look almost the same model of car but you can tell by the headlights that they are not, theirs quite a lot of restrictive rubber on the tracts surface in the background there's gravel overspill and theirs up at the top left hand corner theirs those corrugated fence gate things"
"96",3,"Wedding.3","Erm oh this is a very sweet image here we can see what looks to be the wife's hand the new wife's hand erm putting the marriage ring on the new husbands hand erm the erm brides finger has already got said aforementioned marriage ring thing on  erm they've got matching rings erm the bride is wearing a diamond looking bracelet thing although that's a lot of diamonds might be pearls erm the husband cuff is undone"
"97",3,"Dog.31","here we can see a picture of bear its looking through the glass window of the zoo enclosure it sort of its quite a small bear erm its got brown fur in the background you can see grass and what looks to be a cave so they've  gone down the stylised root of making a zoo enclosure that looks exactly like the stereotype of where a bear might live erm in the foreground towards the left you can see quite a short person just the edge of quite a short person who appears to be wearing some sort of red sweater yellow scarf erm you can see sort of like 1 third of their body erm you can see that erm they've got black hair pale skin and a yellow hat with and I don't know if that's a bobble or not theirs enough visible to tell to the right you've got moss- mostly black coat over what looks to be the side of a Zimmer frame protruding from the side of it so erm I'm going to go with elderly man by the coat erm then in the middle of the frame you've just got the grey concrete bottom of the window then the large window and then the bear in the middle with its paws up on the bars, the cave is oft towards the right hand side of the picture."
"98",3,"Bird.5","Hear we can see a very surprised looking bird being held in someone's hand erm its got its beak slightly open little eyes staring straight at the camera erm tail protruding from the bottom of the hand its someone's right hand and then its feat are protruding between the fingers and the wrist erm the bird does look quite surprised and probably quite miffed to be held like this erm its some form of oh great tit I think I'm bad with ornithology its got white bits protruding across its cheeks from the beak erm top half of its head including the eyes is black and its got a black bit where the beard would be and got sort of yellow sides."
"99",3,"KKK.rally.1","Oh I've seen this one before erm here we've got a klue Klux clan meeting with a load of b- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7se- seven or 8 white clad members in the foreground wearing the Triangular pointy hats with little eye holes cut it all in the standard white uniform and one in black uniform in the centre stood at some form of rather shoddily made lectern they've got the us flag the pictures in grey scale the us flag is next to the lectern and there is a glass of water erm even if you are evil you do need to drink sometimes, they appear to be stood in a grass field and in the background their looks to be smoke and cinders flying so their burning something ah yes a rather upsetting image from history"
"100",3,"Gargoyle.1","Hear we can see well it looks like something out of alien erm or well it's a gargoyle it erm stone work stone carved looks a bit newer than the surrounding stone work erm you can see at the bottom there's sort of ribcage its got 5 toes feat with claws and many many teeth its erm horizontal I assume water gushes from its mouth you can almost see daylight from its mouth although from the wrong angle this making sense with it being a gargoyle"
"101",3,"Bloody.knife.1","here we can see a steak knife, its just been used well a carving knife even erm its just been used to carve a lovely looking slice of lamb erm °I did put my lamb in the yes I did ° er its got a wooden handle its got a nice shiny blade with a serrated edge just at the top  left hand you can see the end of the carving fork my goodness that's a lovely piece of lamb erm you can also see just the bottom of the Pyrex thing for putting gravy in er jug that's the word erm and its erm got gravy in it so this looks to be like it's a picture from their  about to have a roast dinner of roast lamb I'm hungry now I'm really hungry"
"102",3,"Surgery.4","Hear we can see an operating  theatre erm it's got a doctor what looks to be 3 nurses although the 2 in the right could be family members because that doesn't look like nurses uniforms and one patient who is lying mostly obscured by blue bits of paper towel or a white sheet the bed- or everything is blue the colour scheme looks very NHSy and its got the type of lights you get in the  dentist erm presumably the Doctor Surgeon person knows what he is doing there's some white racking off to the left of the photo"
"103",3,"Wedding.7","here we can see some ribbons on a pillow there's some metal bits attached to the ribbons maybe rings from this perspective it is very hard to tell equally they could be the end of usb cables erm there's what looks like there is a very blurry glass in the back top left top middle another very blurry glass I'm unsure of the occasion the ribbons are white and red the pillow is white there might be a bit of wood grain in the bottom left (which would indict) a  wooden table but I really don't know, unknown ribbons"
"104",3,"Plane.crash.4","here we can see someone whose had a quite a serious boating accident there boat is upside down its also not in the water which is wrong  here we can see that they've managed to flip their boat onto the key side I'm not quite sure how because boat don't really go that quick , maybe its out of the water for maintenance or though by the fact that the top is all sort of crumpled this looks like some sort of incident although its not really wet erm it looks like quite a dry day and then you can see the edge of the key side as towards the left you've got a metal ladle with the u shaped top bits and lobster pots which are piled back so maybe the boats been dropped by some sort of crane there are no people in the image and it's a grey flagstone key side thing the ladder oh oh also along with the ladder there's the post you get the wooden post with what looks to be the little rubbery bits that are attached to them so the boats can more up against the key side and then you've also got those t pieces for ropes erm oh can't remember what there're called now erm oh bottom left there is just the edged of a drain cover manhole cover thing it's a square one erm oh and it's a grey day and I'm going to go with this is a British key side and low and behold there is a sea gull as well in the nice grey sky so yeah this is probably Britain"
"105",3,"Alcohol.4","Hear we can see I'm guessing jelly in glasses you've got a red one then a green one then got a red one then a green one a red one then a green one a red one then a green one than a red one then you run out of glasses work out how many that was there's a mirror next to them either that or a sheet of glass and the same lot of glasses lined up on the other side of the mirror  but I but I'm thinking other side of the glass but I'm thinking mirror er there's a vaguely like wine glasses but more wobbly er their on a black granite surfacey think like the one the knife was on earlier erm it's a well-lit room er some sort of event because it looks like there's another row towards the left of the photo but 1 tier down so this is presumably pudding if its jelly or it might be drinks"
"106",3,"Keys.1","Hear we can see a pile of nice antique keys most of them look to be brass but some of them are iron couple of them have leather tags so there not actually historical because they don't tend to come with leather tags if there historical couple of the iron ones are on an iron ring its just a jumble of them its looks vaguely like a scrap heap but made up entirely by iron keys erm the surface there on is wooden you can see little bits in the foreground erm its quite a dimly lit room this one but well enough that you can see they keys I'm concentrating enough to reckon it might be lit by a candle erm most the keys have got a sort of that lovely ornaty bit that it sort of goes in a nice big loop looking like something the dwarves might have made erm so I'm guessing this is supposed to be some sort of key collection but one made by the Victorians as some sort of fake key collection erm to look pretty in their folly or castle or whatever they happened to have got  "
"107",3,"Dog.24","Er here here we can see a dog there is it appears to be stood on part of the outside of an onion and theirs some onion peel a little further back erm its stood next to a curve side I think although its flagstone word everything is flagstoned there's a little plant to the left hand side of the screen and theirs a bottle probably or bag or rolled up bandana with maybe a skull pattern might be an octopus  its small and blarrey the dog looks like it might be blind in one eye erm it does it doesn't look like in the best of condition its probably a stray its got quite a largish black nose and white fur but also you can see patchy skin so yeah it could do with a bit of looking after."
"108",3,"Depressed.face.1","Erm hear we can see a picture of someone looking up, they have not got glasses on you can only actually see their head erm which makes it actually quite difficult to tell much about them they've got a beard erm can't actually tell if they've got any hair because you can only see the face they've got one earing erm I'm going to go with male although its one of those faces where its difficult to tell erm they've got no nose or lip piercing or visible tattoos or other distinguishing features except for a mole in the middle of their left cheek the face is looking towards the upper left hand corner erm the  background around them you can see down the side of the cheek because the face is slightly turned towards the front of the photo but not very turned towards the front of the photo so you can just see down the side of the cheek and underneath their chin which is a fairly standard chin they do not have a double chin its quite a pointy chin actually, the backgroundy bit is yellow in colour probably a painted wall but yeah that hasn't got any distinguishing features on it at all erm they've got very fair eyelashes it's a greyscale photo well not grey scale but primary colours one of those Picasso type things where they've taken block colours which don't like them which also doesn't help with the distinguishing features because you lose so much of the skin texture erm yeah because of the way they've done it the lips are really red (indistinguishable) primary colour scale not normal colour scale anyway"
